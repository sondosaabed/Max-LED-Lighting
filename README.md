# Max LED Lighting
This is a Java desktop application. Two circuit boards (S and L), where S contains n power sources, while L contains LEDs n are given. The source S sorted in ascending order <1, 2, 3, â€¦ , n>, while the LEDs on L are not <2, 9, 5, 14, 3...>. The app connects each LED in L to its pair in S (i.e., 1 with 1, 2 with 2) through unshielded wires, thus when a wire connects a LED (li) in L with its corresponding source in S (si), it may prevent other LEDs from being connected (no two wires may cross).

Example as below, if you connected l1 with s1, then 3 LEDs maximum will be lightened.

In this project I used JavaFX For User Graphical inteface. Applied Longest Common Subsequence algorithm as a dynamic solution. This project is built as an assignment for Algorithm course.

# Running the project 
In order to run the project, needs the JavaFx library to be build on the projecet path. 
The input of the program is: 
n (number of LEDs, say 100).
A permutation of numbers (<1 to n>) :the ordering of the LEDs on the board L.
